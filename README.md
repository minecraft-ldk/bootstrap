# Bootstrap

The bootstrap is an application that does the following :

* Self-extract (if not already done) a packaged electron at ~/.minecraft/electron
* Download/update a launcher from a remote "files/" folder (where should be a updater.php script from [here](https://github.com/minecraft-ldk/lite-bootstrap-remote))
* Self copy (if not already done) itself to ~/.minecraft/launcher
* Install a shortcut (if not already done) on the desktop (application on mac, desktop entry on linux) to its copy
* Launch the downloaded launcher

Everything is configured in src/main/resources/bootstrap.json

The bootstrap (and its configuration file) is supposed to be generated by the [ldk cli](https://github.com/minecraft-ldk/ldk) from a launcher project
